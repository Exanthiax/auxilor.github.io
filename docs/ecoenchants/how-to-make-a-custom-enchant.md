## How to add enchantments
Each enchant is its own config file, placed in the `/enchants/` folder, and you can add or remove them as you please. There's an example config called `_example.yml` to help you out!

The ID of the enchantment is the file name. This is what you use in commands and in the [Item Lookup System](https://plugins.auxilor.io/all-plugins/the-item-lookup-system).
ID's must be lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only.

## Example Enchantment Config

```yaml
display-name: "Example"
description: 
  - "Gives a &a%placeholder%%&8 bonus to damage"
placeholder: "%level% * 20"
placeholders:
  example: "%level% * 800"
type: normal

targets:
  - sword
conflicts:   
  - sharpness
rarity: common 
max-level: 4 
tradeable: true 
discoverable: true 
enchantable: true 
effects:
  - id: damage_multiplier
    args:
      multiplier: 1 + 0.2 * %level%
    triggers:
      - melee_attack

conditions: [ ]
```

## Understanding all the sections:
### The Enchantment Display Section

```yaml
display-name: "Example" # The name of the enchantment in-game
description:
  - "Gives a &a%placeholder%%&8 bonus to damage" # The description of the enchantment
placeholder: "%level% * 20" # The placeholder to show in the enchantment description
placeholders: # [Optional] You can also create multiple placeholders to show in the enchantment description
  example: "%level% * 800"
type: normal # The enchantment type, from types.yml
```

### The Enchantment Mechanics Section

```yaml
targets: # The items that the enchantment can be applied to, see targets.yml
  - sword
conflicts: # The enchantments that conflict with this
  - sharpness
rarity: common # The rarity of the enchantment, see rarity.yml
max-level: 4 # The max level of the enchantment
```

### The Obtaining the Enchantment Section

```yaml
tradeable: true # If the enchantment can be obtained from villagers
discoverable: true # If the enchantment can generate naturally in chests
enchantable: true # If the enchantment can be obtained from enchanting tables
```

### The Effects Section

```yaml
# The effects of the enchantment (i.e. the functionality)
# See here: https://plugins.auxilor.io/effects/configuring-an-effect
# Use %level% as a placeholder for the enchantment level
effects:
  - id: damage_multiplier
    args:
      multiplier: 1 + 0.2 * %level%
    triggers:
      - melee_attack

# The conditions required to use the enchantment,
# you can use %level% as a placeholder here too
conditions: [ ]
```

The effects section is the core functionality of the Enchantment. You can configure effects, conditions, filters, mutators and triggers in this section to run whilst the enchant is active.

Check out Configuring an Effect to understand how to configure this section correctly.

For more advanced users or setups, you can configure chains in this section to string together different effects under one trigger. Check out Configuring an Effect Chain for more info.

## Internal Placeholders

| Placeholder | Value                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%level%`   | Returns the level of the custom enchantment. Useful for creating enchantments that get stronger as the level increases. |
